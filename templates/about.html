  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>

  This website aims to alarm about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Extinction:_An_Unnatural_History">The Sixth Extinction</a> that is currently happening right under our eyes. We are right into the beginning of a historical accelerated, widespread mass extinction which is scientifically proven to be caused by human development.

  No machine learning, no big data, no blockchain, the title is a tongue in cheek joke about webpages such as <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com">This person does not exist</a> or <a href="https://theselyricsdonotexist.com/">These Lyrics Do Not Exist</a>.

  </p>
  <p>

  The animals listed on this website are classified as <strong>Extinct</strong> or <strong>Extinct in the Wild</strong>. I understand that it can be a bit of a hyperbole saying that extinct in the wild animals no longer exist. I understand that there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_reintroduction">reintroduction programs</a> and some are very successful, but those are only a drop in the bucket in front of the massive drop in biodiversity we are currently living.
