This project aims to alarm about The Sixth Extinction that is currently
happening right under our eyes. We are right into the beginning of a historical
accelerated, widespread mass extinction which is scientifically proven to be
caused by human development.

No machine learning, no big data, no blockchain, the title is a tongue in cheek
joke about webpages such as This person does not exist or These Lyrics Do Not
Exist.
